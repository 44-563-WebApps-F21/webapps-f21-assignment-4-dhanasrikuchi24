    <h3>Lord Windermere</h3>
    <p>
        1.LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes—who has called?
        2.LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to her_.]  Don’t say that, Margaret.  I
        never loved any one in the whole world but you.
        3.LORD WINDERMERE.  I did not take a house for her.
        4.LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne—
        5.LORD WINDERMERE.  Her husband died many years ago.  She is alone in the
        world.
        6.LORD WINDERMERE.  [_L.C._]  Margaret, I was saying to you—and I beg you
        to listen to me—that as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, she has
        conducted herself well.  If years ago—
        7.LADY WINDERMERE.  I am not interested in her—and—you should not mention
        this woman and me in the same breath.  It is an error of taste.
        [_Sitting R. at desk_.]
        8.LORD WINDERMERE.  I entreat you.  People may chatter about her, do
        chatter about her, of course, but they don’t know anything definite
        against her.  She has been to several houses—not to houses where you
        would go, I admit, but still to houses where women who are in what is
        called Society nowadays do go.  That does not content her.  She wants you
        to receive her once.
        9.LORD WINDERMERE.  [_L.C._]  Margaret, you are talking foolishly,
        recklessly.  I won’t argue with you, but I insist upon your asking Mrs.
        Erlynne to-night.
