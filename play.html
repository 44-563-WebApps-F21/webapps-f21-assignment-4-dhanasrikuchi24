            <p class="stage-direction">LADY WINDERMERE</p>

            <p class="speech">How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
                hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
                lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LORD DARLINGTON</p>

            <p class="speech">They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
                table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY WINDERMERE</p>

            <p class="speech">Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
                everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
                present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LORD DARLINGTON</p>

            <p class="speech">No?  Is it really?</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY WINDERMERE</p>

            <p class="speech">Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
                life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
                down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY WINDERMERE</p>

                    Mrs. Erlynne is!  She is coming to lunch on Thursday, won’t you come too?
                    I expect the Bishop and dear Lady Merton.

                    [_Sits on sofa_.]  And I see that there are just as many fools in society
                    as there used to be.  So pleased to find that nothing has altered!
                    Except Margaret.  She’s grown quite pretty.  The last time I saw
                    her—twenty years ago, she was a fright in flannel.  Positive fright, I
                    assure you.  The dear Duchess! and that sweet Lady Agatha!  Just the type
                    of girl I like!  Well, really, Windermere, if I am to be the Duchess’s
                    sister-in-law—</p>
